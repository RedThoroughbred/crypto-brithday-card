# GeoGift - Location-Verified Crypto Gift Cards

> Transform passive money gifts into active, memorable experiences through gamified location-based unlocking.

## 🎯 Vision

GeoGift revolutionizes digital gifting by combining crypto payments with real-world treasure hunt experiences. Instead of simply sending money, gift-givers create location-based puzzles that recipients must solve to unlock their funds, creating lasting memories and educational crypto experiences.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Location-Based Unlocking**: Recipients receive clues to find specific GPS coordinates
- **Crypto Escrow**: Smart contracts hold funds until location verification
- **Multi-Currency Support**: ETH, stablecoins, with fiat on/off-ramps
- **Gamified Experience**: Simple to complex treasure hunt mechanics
- **Youth Financial Integration**: Partnerships with SoFi, Robinhood for account setup
- **Layer 2 Optimization**: Built on Polygon for low-cost transactions
