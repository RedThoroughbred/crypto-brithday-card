# Testing Visual Clue System

## Current Implementation Status

✅ **Completed:**
1. Created `StepUnlockDisplay` component with support for all 7 unlock types
2. Added `react-markdown` dependency for markdown rendering
3. Updated chain claiming page to use the new component
4. Implemented unlock logic for different step types

## Visual Clue System Features

### Supported Unlock Types:
1. **GPS** ✅ - Fully functional with location verification
2. **Video** ⚡ - UI implemented, shows "coming soon" message
3. **Image** ⚡ - UI implemented, shows "coming soon" message  
4. **Markdown** ✅ - Fully functional with ReactMarkdown rendering
5. **Quiz** ✅ - Fully functional with answer input and hints
6. **Password** ✅ - Fully functional with password input and hints
7. **URL** ⚡ - UI implemented, shows "coming soon" message

### Component Features:
- Dynamic icon display based on unlock type
- Contextual UI for each unlock mechanism
- Password visibility toggle
- Quiz hint system
- Markdown content rendering
- Proper loading and error states

## Testing Instructions

1. **Access existing chain**: Visit http://localhost:3000/chain/1
2. **Test GPS unlock**: Current chains use GPS type (stepType: 0)
3. **View different step types**: Component handles different stepType values gracefully

## Next Steps

To fully test all unlock types, we would need to:

1. **Update Chain Creation**: Add step type selection in create-chain wizard
2. **Implement Smart Contract Support**: Ensure contract handles all step types
3. **Test End-to-End**: Create chains with mixed unlock types

## Current Limitations

- Chain creation only supports GPS type currently
- Video/Image/URL types show placeholder messages
- Smart contract may need updates for non-GPS verification

The visual clue system infrastructure is complete and ready for testing once we add step type selection to the chain creation process.
