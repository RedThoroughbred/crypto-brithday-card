So a giver could break up a gift, and assign multiple locations, at each location even activate a photo, recording, or small video (all with a cost). This allows people to have storage of memories or import them to their cloud storage (ideally the latter). 

So the unlocking would work like this, with media, get to the geotagged location, then the person (only a certain cell number), would get a text and then click a link to get a code (the problem here is cell service), code is texted and they choose the account they want. It would be nice that once they went to the Lat,long, by GPS being enabled, then they could initiate once in cell service. 

It would have to be secure and not able to be intercepted. The concept is a start, but cell service-dependent could be a challenge. I would say the exception and not the rule. Maybe when the cell number is entered, the carrier map would only allow the pin to be dropped in areas with some sort of service. I will keep thinking on it. 

The giver could be alerted when a receiver gets to an area. 

There needs to be an AR component where the sender generates the 3d object with ai by explaining it which will show up in the exact location so when the viewer is pulled up from the app, they could see the object which will unlock something.
